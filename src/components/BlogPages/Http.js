                        HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a protocol for secure communication over the internet.
                        It's the "S" at the end of "HTTPS" that makes all the difference. When a website uses HTTPS, it means that all communications between the website and the user's browser are encrypted, making it much more difficult for anyone to intercept or tamper with the data being sent.

                        Another reason why HTTPS is important for digital marketing is that it can help with search engine optimization (SEO).
                        Google has stated that they give a slight ranking boost to websites that use HTTPS, as they consider them to be more secure.
                        This means that businesses that use HTTPS may have an advantage in search engine rankings over those that do not. Additionally, Google Chrome now marks all HTTP websites as "Not Secure" which will affect user experience and bounce rate.

                        This includes sensitive information like credit card numbers, login credentials, and personal information. By using HTTPS, businesses can ensure that this information is protected from potential hackers or other malicious actors.
